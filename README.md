# Yelp Review Authenticity Study 

Repository to store progress on Assignment 2 of
course Large Scale Data Analysis.

## Assignment Description

In 2019,
a [study](https://ny.eater.com/2019/1/18/18183973/authenticity-yelp-reviews-white-supremacy-trap)
looked into the use of the word "authentic" in
Yelp reviews and how it was used to signal
different characteristics from cuisine to cuisine.
They found that, for example, in Chinese and
Mexican restaurants, the word was used to describe
typically negative things like "dirty", "kitsch"
or "cheap", where Italian and French restaurants
used to signal high quality and delicious details.
The author sees this tendency as harmful, trapping
non-white restaurant-owners in negative
stereotypes. The task was to test the study by
analysing large scale data (yelp reviews) using
Spark in a distributed cluster of computing and
storage nodes.
